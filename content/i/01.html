<br><h3>Getting Started</h3>

<h4>Let me put it straight ahead, so we don't have to go over it again.
	<br>
	Life is hard, farming is harder.
	<br>
	Not trying to demotivate you, but giving enough of a disclaimer that whatever you prepared for as the worst that could happen to you, start thinking beyond that. Being close to the earth is not just awesome for photos, earth makes you work for it when its your day job.
	<br>
	"A hopeless workman blames his tools", that is one early learning I can still recollect and associate with the instances where I have felt humbled by a blunt chisel.</h4>
<br>
	<h3>What are these farming tools we are talking about and not showing?</h3>
	<h4>Beyond the sticks and metal machines, the most powerful human tools are inside our body. I could put a picture of a brain in here, or as a former US President would say, some internal organ from the lower part of his body. <br>
		Technically we have evolved as a species to take machines like computers for granted. The binary adders have evolved into these scary Artificial Intelligence thingies that could run civilizations. In farming, at a small scale, with no fancy automated GPS drivers ...
		<br>
		The diversion was intentional. We are at a point in our lives where the boundary between machine capability and human limitations has been blurred, beyond recognition.
		<br>
		Open a spreadsheet program on your computer, It could be called Excel, Calc, Sheets, or Pages (no offense to any obscure program like Lotus 123 I have intentionally left out)<br>
		Call the first column "2Plant" (as I think, ymmw ;)
		Call the second column "GerminationDays"
		Look up some Universities Extension Services, or Ministry Farming resources to populate the table, or click here to pull a sample sheet here.
		<br>
		Stare at it for a few minutes, (been there, done that) seriously! Yes, that is not what the time-lapse video said (don't stare at the seeds for long, they change shapes ...you have been warned!)
		<br>
		If you are still here, we have been able to identify what could be some plants that you can start with and some sort of likelihood of seedlings you can work with.
	</h4><br>
	<h3>Wait a minute!</h3>
	<h4> Didn't you say that the seeds had to be planted?
		<br> Where did the seedlings come into play?
		<br>
		Well ....
		<br>
		Didn't we talk about farming being harder than routine life earlier?
		<br>
		Seriously!
		<br>
		You can plant seeds and wonder why nothing showed up, or you could plant the seedlings and blame the birds eager to snatch your seedlings because they looked like worms
		<br>
		If you skipped this section, you missed no life-saving information.
		<br> There is no life-saving information being distributed in the rest of the site either.
		<h3> Caveat Emptor </h3>
		<h4> Or as I understood it, if you did not see it coming, don't blame me.
