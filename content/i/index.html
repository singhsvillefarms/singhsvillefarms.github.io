<h4>Everything starts with a plan. What is construed as a lack of plan actually implies the lack of 'a well structured plan that addresses common use-cases, deficiencies, failure modes, and fallback scenarios.
  So, lets examine each of these plan elements in the context of a farm</h4>

<h3>Subsistence Agriculture</h3>
<h4>Simply put, grow enough to feed yourself and your family. Its common for this use-case be ignored or skipped to progress further. Progress has a strong dependency on this use-case so skipping it introduces more assumptions than are necessary.
<br>
Where you are located (in lattitude, longitude, and altitude as well as wind flows, groundwater, soil conditions, time of the year, climate of the area, current weather conditions ...) play a large part in determining your success in the Subsistence use case.
<br>
A lot of experts (experimenters like me included) have a tendency to skip over things that seem obvious. In farming, this nuance is often missed out by those new to the task. For this precise reason I tried to list some location parameters for you to understand what all you should be aware of.
