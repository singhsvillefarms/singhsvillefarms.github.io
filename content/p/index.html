<h4>For the purpose of this exercise, a rectangular plot of around one acre was chosen.
The boundaries were marked out into four (4) feet wide rows with two beds of around ninety (90) feet, spaced eight (8) feet apart to allow for turning of farm equipment as well as having a clear path to approach all beds.
The beds were spaced around eighteen (18) inches to accomodate for tractor tires when the tractor is going over the grow bed.
